  					<p>Most of students in Computer Science major enters via Direct Admission(roughly 50% to 55%) and transfer admission
               (roughly 15% to 20%). The department states that it leaves 30% of their spot for current UW students. Even though
               this percentage may seem doable to some, the applicant numbers are increasing each admission term and the
               CS department stated that these seats are mostly for UW students who found interest in CS after enrolling at UW.
               While the Current Student Admission rate is 20% to 25%, if you were not offered Direct Admission and planning to get in
               by Current Student Admission, the chances are extremely low. The Allen school says you should come to UW to study CS
               <strong>"only if you are willing to pursue a concentration in CS through [their] non-major courses"</strong>, if you are not a
               Direct Admit. Below are other options for Computer Science that you could focus on rather than CS at UW:
               <ul>
                 <li>Applied and Computational Mathematical Science(ACMS)</li>
                 <li>Informatics</li>
