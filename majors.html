					<p>Hosted through the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science, which offers a B.S degree
					with a major in Computer Science or a B.S in computer engineering. The former will be covered

					<p><strong>Applicant Admittance Types:</strong> <em>Freshman Direct Admissions,
					Regular Admissions, Transfer Admissions</em>
					<p><strong>Regular Admission Pre-Reqs:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>MATH Series (MATH 124, 125, and 126 or equivalent)</li>
						<li>5 Natural World Cr - Including one of the following or equivalent:
						<ul>
							<li>PHYS 121</li>

							<li>BIOL 180</li>
						</ul>
						<li>CSE 142</li>
						<li>CSE 143</li>
						<li>At least 5 English Composition Cr</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Transfer Admission Pre-Reqs:</strong> Minimum 30 graded college credits before transfer

						<li>MATH Series (MATH 124, 125, and 126 or equivalent)</li>

						</ul>
						<li>CSE 142</li>
						<li>CSE 143</li>
						<li>At least 5 English Composition Cr</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This is arguably the <em>most</em> selective major offered at UW. Maybe, along with Computational
					Engineering, it is in the top 3 of hardest majors to get into. Computer Science recently transitioned
					so that if you are not a Freshman Direct Admit or a Transfer student, your odds of getting in through
					regular admission are EXTREMELY (almost 0) low, unless you discovered the major late in your college
					career. There is little point in applying if you do not fit these aforementioned categories.

				<p>Informatics is a capacity-constrained/selective major with a LOT of applicants. Many who come to UW for
				CSE and do not get in choose this major as a secondary option. As a result, there is a 2 application maximum,
				so it is encouraged to make yourself competitive with above average grades (around ~3.5) and a great
				admissions essay.
