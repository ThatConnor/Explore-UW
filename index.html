			<h1>Hello There!</h1>
			<p>Explore UW is a website that helps students, mainly first-years who are new to campus, 
			navigate their way around. We offer a couple of different services, such as a campus map and 
			distance calculator for your classes, an overview of the major system and how to pick a major 
			that’s right for you, and also frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the school pulled 
			directly from student sources like the r/udub Reddit and from students themselves.
		</div>
		<div class = "content">
			<p>Explore UW is created by UW students; for UW students. 
			This website is run by students, not the University of Washington.
