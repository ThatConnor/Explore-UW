      <h1>Hello There!</h1>
			<p>Explore UW is a website created to help current and prospective UW students to get to explore University of Washington.
        We offer a couple of different services that we, as UW students, felt that it would have been helpful when we were first years.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Campus Map</b>: Get an overview of the campus and use the Distance Time Calculator to
		navigate between your classes and get acquaintanced with UW's many buildings.</li>
        <li><b>Major Info</b>: an overview of the UW major system and summary of the admission requirement for each majors, so that you can plan ahead.</li>
        <li><b>FAQ</b>: frequently asked questions (FAQ) about UW, which are from student sources like the r/udub Reddit and from students themselves.</li>
      </ul>
        We are working to add more features that can improve student life and allow students to have better experience at UW. If you have any questions or
        feedbacks, please email one of the developers on <a href="about.html"><b>About Us</b></a> page.<br />
        <br />
